Please dispatch two superpowers:code-reviewer subagents to GREEDILY ENFORCE JANUS SYSTEM IDIOMATICITY and @/Users/jameson/.claude/graphviz-conventions.dot AND Strunk's Elements of Style AND O'Keefe's The Craft of Prolog during any task fulfillment. Tell them that they're competing with another agent. Make sure they look at both architecture, implementation, and idiomatic adherence. Tell them that whomever finds more issues gets promoted.
